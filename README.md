# Classification of Objects using Deep Learning Model
Training a Deep learning model to classify images of bricks, balls or cylinders against a cluttered background using the pre-trained Alexnet model in fastai/pytorch, to perform classification, detection and segmentation simultaneously.

# Dataset

Dataset includes 1k images of bricks, balls and cylinders placed in with other surrounding objects.

# Implementation and Results

> Implemented methods like classification of images, creation of the bounding boxes around particular objects and segmentation of the images for easier analysis of different objects.
> Training the fastai model for multi-task learning using bbcâ€“1k dataset which includes images of bricks, balls and cylinders.
> Model achieved 95% accuracy.
