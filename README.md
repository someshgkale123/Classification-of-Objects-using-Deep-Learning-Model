# Classification-of-Objects-using-Deep-Learning-Model
Training a Deep learning model to classify images of bricks, balls or cylinders against a cluttered background using the pre-trained Alexnet model in fastai/pytorch, to perform classification, detection and segmentation simultaneously.

> Implemented methods like classification of images, creation of the bounding boxes around particular objects and segmentation of the images for easier analysis of different objects.
> Training the fastai model for multi-task learning using bbcâ€“1k dataset which includes images of bricks, balls and cylinders.
> Technologies used :  numpy, pandas, openCV, scikit-learn, scipy, python, pytorch, fastai, google colab
